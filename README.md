## Workshop API Security

This repository contains samples for the workshop API Security.

# Running the samples of the workshop

The samples run with Docker Compose.
So please ensure you have docker installed in a recent version.

Start the examples by typing

```
docker compose up --build
```

from within the folder you cloned the repository.

# Exercise Client Credentials

You can access the keycloak authentication server via http://localhost:9191/auth/admin/

## Available users

The following users with their passwords and roles are available:

* admin / admin123 (role admin)
* erika / erika123 (role user)
* max / max123 (role user)
* james / james123 (role user)

## Receiving a token 

Use the following request to receive a token:
```
POST http://localhost:9191/auth/realms/master/protocol/openid-connect/token
```
Header:
```
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
```
Body:
```
grant_type:password
client_id:onlineshop
username:erika
password:erika123
```

## Validate an address

You can validate an address via the following endpoint:

```
POST http://localhost:4003/valid-addresses
```

Headers:
```
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```
Body:
```
{
    "recipient": "Erika Mustermann",
    "street": {
        "name": "Poststra√üe",
        "number": "1"
    },
    "city": "26122 Oldenburg"
}
```

This request will fail, since erika is not allowed to validate addresses anymore.

## Receiving client credential token

Validation of addresses is only allowed for machine-to-machine calls.
Receive a valid token via the following request:

```
POST http://localhost:9191/auth/realms/master/protocol/openid-connect/token
```
Header:
```
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
```
Body:
```
grant_type:client_credentials
client_id:address-validation
client_secret:e7bea4b5-7c65-4d78-9404-0646cd198150
```

Try the address validation with this token and see, that it now works.

## Troubleshooting (Mac M1 processor)

The keycloak image used in some of the excercises
is not compatible with the new M1 processor of Mac.
